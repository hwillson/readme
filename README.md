## Brief

- I write a lot of code.
- I've been writing a lot of code (professionally) for the past 22 years.
- I'm currently focused on web and mobile.

## Not Brief

Aloha! I’m Hugh, a technology enthusiast who has spent way too much time over the past many years baking in the warmth of a computer monitor. I’ve been working with computers since well before they became a household staple, and continue to love pushing them in new directions through code. I’ve spent the past 20+ years working as a professional software developer, touching on just about every kind of software development project imaginable. I've worked with mom and pops, fortune 500′s, government, and everyone in-between, on projects
ranging in size from simple promo websites to full fledged financial litigation systems. Looking for someone to help out on your next project? I’d love to hear about it!
