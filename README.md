## Not Brief

Aloha! I’m Hugh, a technology enthusiast who has spent way too much time over
the past many years baking in the warmth of a computer monitor. I’ve been
working with computers since well before they became a household staple, and
continue to love pushing them in new directions through code. I’ve spent the
past 19 years working as a professional software developer, touching on just
about every kind of software development project imaginable. I've worked with
mom and pops, fortune 500′s, government, and everyone in-between, on projects
ranging in size from simple promo websites to full fledged financial litigation
systems. Looking for someone to help out on your next project? I’d love to hear
about it!
